Getting Started with OpenCV using Python

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is an image & video processing library, which helps developers from C, C++, Java & Python background to use these libraries for performing different tasks such a facial recognition, detection, number plate detection, photo editing and much more.

## Requirements

1. Python 3 
2. OpenCV - Image & Video Processing library. (https://opencv.org/)  
3. Numpy - A fundamental package for scientific computing. (http://www.numpy.org/)
4. Matplotlib - A 2D plotting library. (https://matplotlib.org/) 

## Installations

### For Linux/Mac User using pip

1. Install Numpy using `apt-get install python3-numpy`
2. Install Matplotlib using `apt-get install python3-matplotlib`
3. Install OpenCV using `apt-get install python3-opencv`

*Note - You can also try installing OpenCv using conda. [ReadMe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19876079/opencv-cannot-find-module-cv2)*

4. Once done, try importing these modules in the python interpreter.
